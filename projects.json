    "description": "SYMBIOTICA is the podcast and newsletter of BEAM, a creative studio for climate innovation. I built its identity and web system to stand on its own while still belonging to the BEAM-verse—balancing high-tech futurism with archival memory to create an immersive, cinematic space for exploring the future of climate design.<br><br>This project was developed in collaboration with BEAM over the course of 6 months. The world of Symbiotica is influenced by the texture of classical scientific photography and analog music mechanisms, overlaid with our distinctly digital interfaces.<br><br>In addition to my direction and branding work, I designed and implemented Symbiotica's bespoke website, which takes inspiration from analog hi-fi (music) technology with the help of AI tools like Claude and ChatGPT to bring my work to life.",

    "description": "Each year, we spend more time confined to an increasingly digital landscape. Meanwhile, climate change has increased insect-borne diseases 300x in the last decade, making the outdoors feel less like an escape and more like a risk. Swarm® wants to change that.<br><br>Swarm® isn't just bug repellent—it's an invitation to rediscover the magic of being outside. To feel grass under your feet as the sun goes down. To remember what it was like to play until the streetlights came on.<br><br>Drawing from the whimsy of 80s editorial ads and the bold, playful graphics of the 60s, Swarm®'s identity exists in a space between memory and future: a brand that feels both impossibly familiar and refreshingly new. It's the sunset you remember from childhood, but brighter. It's nostalgia for a future that hasn't happened yet.<br><br>Swarm® is part longing, part speculation, all wonder. This project is still in development, check back for updates soon.",
